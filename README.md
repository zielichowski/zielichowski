### Hi üëã

I've been interested in programming since I first saw a computer in 1997. However, my first 10 years were spent playing computer games. (In retrospect, I don't regret a single minute of it). 
Over time, I learned the C/C++ language and from high school, through college I used it studing all the wonderful low-level stuff. I programmed microcontrollers and had a great time doing projects using STM32. (Such as a house light that turns on when you clap). 

Over the last decade I've been a software engineer involved with the JVM ecosystem. I'm very interested in domain-driven design, software architecture and how to choose the right solution for a given problem. I am not emotionally attached to any of the patterns like layered architecture, hexagonal architecture, event sourcing, frameworkless, anemic domain model, rich domain model, etc. The key is to know how and when to use them. As someone said: "In software engineering there are no good choices there are only trade-offs."

I think I have worked with most of the hot technologies in my career, here are some of them:
- Java, Kotlin, Python, C++,
- Sql/NoSql databases,
- Aws/Azure cloud,
- Sns/Sqs/RabittMQ/Kafka,
- Docker/Kubernetes,
- ...
However, I believe that technologies come and go, while certain programming fundamentals remain unchanged over the years. 

I consider myself a backend developer, but from time to time I happen to work in the frontend. However, I believe that 95% (my magic number, not confirmed by any research) of applications needing frontend can be written using server-side rendering with htmx. 

üìù I irregularly write post on my [blog](https://javacaptain.dev/)
